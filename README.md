## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **stock price fluctuations** across different timeframes (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly).  
- Examine **key metrics** — open, close, high, low, and trading volume.  
- Identify **patterns and volatility** across multiple companies.  
- Visualize trends using **Power BI dashboards** for clear interpretation.  
- Provide **actionable insights** for investors, analysts, and business strategists.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preparation**  
- Gathered historical stock price data (2013–2018) including `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, and `Stock Name`.  
- Cleaned and formatted the dataset for consistency and time-series analysis.  

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Conducted descriptive statistics to study price distribution, volatility, and trading activity.  
- Used **Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy)** for visualization and exploration.  
- Compared stock performances (AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, PCLN, etc.) over time.  

3️⃣ **Visualization in Power BI**  
- Created an **interactive dashboard** showing key metrics and performance indicators.  
- Included visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots to illustrate price and volume relationships.  

4️⃣ **Final Report Generation**  
- Summarized the entire 4-week analysis into a **structured PDF report**, covering methods, results, insights, and implications.
